Introduction : 
pygenesis is meant to generate whole planets with a proper geological model.

TODO :

1 : Implement simplex noise to seed points all over the sphere
2 : Apply a voronoi tesselation over said points, resulting in an implementation of Worley noise (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worley_noise)
3 : Find an algorithm to merge Voronoi cells in order to have tectonic plates
4 : Apply geological rules in order to generate a heightmap
5 : Further plans (erosion, rivers, rendering)
